    <h1>Kia ora Taiao! Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my website home page, 
      can't wait to see what it looks like by the end of this. 
      
      Kia ora, I'm Mitchell, I'm 30yo and this is the start of my Dev journey.
      Just a quick run through my career and how I got here.
      
      Born and raised in Hamilton, 
      I've been bouncing from job to job since I left high school,
      mainly worked in the dairy industry but felt like that was a waste of the potential I felt I had, 
      that and it was bloody lonesome in the country usually the middle of nowhere, hours away from friends and family, 
      so I bounced(literally) from that to landscaping, 
      then digital design and sign writing, 
      then engineering and welding, 
      then building, 
      then I started my own fencing company,
      well.... you get the picture haha.
     
      I've always liked playing around on computers and 
      the idea of potentially earning money with them sometime in the future excites me.
      I'm really eager to to learn and glad I started this journey with you all.
