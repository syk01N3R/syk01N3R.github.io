    <h1>Kia ora Taiao! Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>This is the beginning of my website home page, 
      can't wait to see what it looks like by the end of this.</h2> 
      
      <p>Kia ora, I'm Mitchell, I'm 30yo and this is the start of my Dev journey.
      Just a quick run through my career and how I got here.</p>
      
      <p>Born and raised in Hamilton, 
      I've been bouncing from job to job since I left high school,
      mainly worked in the dairy industry but felt like that was 
      a waste of potential, that and it was bloody lonesome in the country 
      usually the middle of nowhere, hours away from friends and family, 
      so I bounced(literally) and from that 
      to landscaping, 
      then digital design and sign writing, 
      then engineering and welding, 
      then building, 
      then I started my own fencing company,
      well.... you get the picture I never really settled anywhere for more then a year or two.</p>
     
      <p>I've always liked playing around on computers and 
      the idea of potentially earning money with them sometime in the future excites me.
      I'm really eager to to learn and glad I started this journey with you all.
