        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

        <h2>I was blocked by a problem</h2>
        <p>Struggled to resize an img for like 2 days and nothing was working. I had asked my friend and gone down countless dead ends on google, eventually I just went over kill on it and tried like 4 different methods of resizing it, finally managed to figure out how to resize it, I also learnt how to set an img as the background and realised that even though it took me 2 days to solve this problem which in my mind should have been way easier then it was, actually wasn’t too much of a waste of time because of how much else I had learnt along the way while solving the issue.</p>

        <h2>Elegantly Solved a problem</h2>

        <p>When I was blocked on a simple problem, unsurprisingly this happens a lot to me. One simple problem I recall is when I noticed there was a background colour that left a box that had no text in it, so I was wondering why it was even there. I looked at the code above the box and the code below the box so I could pin point where this box was getting made . I found the code above and below but still couldn’t see what was going wrong because there was nothing there, I ended up scrolling across the page and realising that there was a little paragraph tag, took the p tag out and the problem disappeared. I learnt I should always take my time checking code faults because sometimes the problems aren’t actually that big. And can easily be missed.</p>


        <h2>Reflect on problem solving techniques</h2>
        
        <p>I feel fairly confident that I have used and incorporated most of the following problem solving techniques/processes. My favourite methods would be try something, google, and asking isaac although I need to work on making that list of people I can ask for help a bit bigger, I just struggle to ask for help because I don't want to be seen as stupid or incapable or let people know how far behind I am, I guess for me it's just the shame or my pride that stops me asking. (Need to work on this, in order to become the most capable version of me)</p>
