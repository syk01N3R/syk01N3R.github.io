    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> </h2>
    <h3>I like that quote haha</h3>


   <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3> 
<p>Id quite like to get into game development and design in the future, maybe some data analytical stuff. 
    Mainly I just want to have the skills to earn money from any location I have internet, 
    I would say that is the goal to have freedom not to be locked to one location.
    I enjoy travelling when I can afford it and having that freedom alows me to work from where ever I choose.</p>
<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
<p>I would put my strengths in learning around my creativeness, numbers, learning formulas and creating noticing patterns. I think I struggle to concentrate for extended periods of time and happen to be a pretty bad procrastinator.</p> 
<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>My ability to network with people, and also learning to ask for help.</p>
<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
<p>This should include:
    An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p> 
<p>I will manage my workload by putting in as many hours as possible on task, Journaling and setting goals along the way.</p>
<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3> 
<p>I will message my facilitator and/or in tech-questions as to not get stuck on a topic for too long.</p>
<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
<p>Assistance where needed along my learning journey.</p>
